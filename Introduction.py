# Soft and Hard Skills
st.write("# Hard and Soft Skills")
st.write("A professional that has been working in his field for over a year or so will pick up a lot of knowledge and"
         " experience and when he has to solve a problem he will focus on his knowledge and experience that he has "
         "gained over the years before reaching out to others or look for an external solution.")

st.write("But, this knowledge and experience can only help him with his technical problems that occur and not with a"
         "problem that has occurred between him and another colleague or manager."
         "To solve these kinds of problems he will need to use his soft skills that consist of having the ability to "
         "communicate well with others and handling pressure and managing and even leading teams.")

st.markdown("> Hard skills help you solve technical problems and soft skills help you solve people problems.")

# Productivity
st.write("# What is Productivity?")
st.write("## Defining Productivity ")
st.write("When the industrial revolution started productivity was the amount of product a factory worker or machine "
         "could make in a day,")
st.latex( "Productivity = Total\;product / Time\;taken")
st.write("In our time,  productivity is measured by how many items can you check off of your todo list or how many "
         "emails can you respond to in a working day.")
st.write("## The Productivity Equation")
st.write("Modern productivity can be explained by a simple equation, this equation counts productivity as work that is "
         "actually useful to the individual or company and not the work we do to get out of our "
         "actual responsibilities.")

st.markdown("The more `useful output` we can generate in the least amount of time is the amount of `productive work` "
            "that we did in a day.")
st.latex(r''' Productivity =\frac{Useful\;output}{Time\;taken} ''')
st.write("## The Fun Factor")
st.write("If we're working on a task that is boring and we aren't having fun doing it then our productivity will"
         "decrease even if we are producing a useful output.  If we're doing something that excites us or is fun to do"
         "then our productivity increases even if we're doing something that's totally useless. ")
st.write("Taking this same approach to having fun while doing work we can add a fun factor to almost any task that we "
         "need to accomplish and it won't be a bother for us since doing that task will be now fun.")

st.latex(r'''Productivity = \frac{Useful\;output}{Time\;taken} \times Fun factor''')
st.write("By multiplying the amount of useful work done in a day by how fun it was doing it we can see a potentially "
         "high increase in the productivity of an individual or team.")

st.write("## Fancy Tools")
st.write("You can use the most fanciest tools available and even use the most number of apps and services that say that"
         "they increase your productivity but if you don't know how to use the app or the app seems to complex then "
         "you'll just waste time tinkering with the app or service instead of using it to get actual work done.")
st.write("> Tools and services don't matter, it's the techniques and systems that matter. ")

# Planning Ahead
st.write("# Planning Ahead of time")
st.write("Planning your day the night before is a great approach when you just want to wake up, have breakfast and "
         "then just start working on the things that matter the most instead of wasting time deciding what task to "
         "tackle first.")
st.write("## The Pilot, Plane ,and Engineer")
st.write("The pilot, plane, and engineer mental model is a mindset that guides you to plan your day ahead and then" 
         "makes sure that there are no road blocks in your way when your going throughout the day.")
st.markdown("""

- The pilot is the role you take on every night when you're trying to schedule your tasks for the next
             day.
- The plane is the role you take on during the after waking up and already knowing what tasks are needed 
            to be done first and getting to work.
- The engineer is a role that is used in conjunction with the plane. Engineer is the role you take on 
            when there are road blocks in your plane's journey.""")

# Productivity Myths
st.write("# Myths About Productivity")
st.write("There are many different myths that people have come up with around productivity and most of them are false "
         "and most just an excuse to not work.")
st.write("## Not Enough Time")
st.write("The most common excuse for not doing work that a person needed to do is that they didn't have enough time to "
         "do it. Which is totally wrong in a sense that all human beings get 24 hours in a day and how you choose to "
         "spend those 24 hours is up to you.")
st.write("You can finish your required tasks and then go to the gym or take a walk outside, or even cook a nice dinner "
         "but most people would rather prefer takeout, watching Netflix, and scrolling through social media.")
st.write("> You already have the time to do everything you want to do. It's just that you choose not to do it.")

st.write("## Not Enough Motivation")
st.write("The second myth is also kind of made up, people don't work towards there goals that they set because they "
         "don't see an immediate result and feel like they haven't made any progress at all and give up half way,")
st.write("Motivation isn't the thing that you should use an excuse because motivation is just a little burst of energy "
         "that everyone gets when we are relaxed and excited for something. Once that burst of energy dies down then "
         "we're back to our old selves again.")
st.write("Instead of using Motivation as a fuel source for achieving your goals make it a habit of doing the same task"
         "every day and be consistent with completing it.")
st.write("Being consistent is what will give you the results you want the fastest and will make you feel more motivated"
         "towards completing your goals and the more goals you complete the more motivated you'll become.")

st.write("## Always Multitasking")
st.write("Human brains are not made for doing multiple things at once and multitasking may seem like it's a great way "
         "to increase our productivity but in reality it's not.")
st.write("If you focus on a single task at a time and give all you attention to that task then you'll enter your flow "
         "state. The flow state is the state in which your body and mind are at their peek performance levels and your "
         "productivity is also at it's peak.")
st.write("Multitasking doesn't let this happen because whenever you switch tasks you also shift your mental context "
         "and the brain needs time to adapt to this new context which also decreases your productivity.")

# Laws of Productivity
st.write("# Scientific Laws and Productivity")
st.write("There are many different scientific laws that we can use in our daily lives in order to increase our "
         "productivity. ")
st.write("## Parkinson's Law")
st.write("This law states that work will expand over time that we have allocated it. Meaning that the more time you "
         "give to complete a task the more time it will take to complete it.")
st.write("Parkinson's law helps us to boost our productivity by assigning ourselves `artificial` deadlines."
         "Complete an assignment today whose deadline is next week, by doing this we are generating more useful output"
         "in the least amount of time and are not letting our work expand over time.")
st.write("## Pareto's Principle")
st.write("Pareto's principle suggests that 80% of our work can be completed in just 20% of the effort. ")
st.write("The Pareto principle blends into productivity easily because if you are studying for an upcoming test it's a "
         "proven fact that 80% of the test questions will come from the 20% of the syllabus which is the core part of "
         "that subject.")
st.write("## Newton's First Law of Motion")
st.write("Newton's first law of motion is also applicable to productivity and how we can increase it.")
st.write("> An object will stay at rest or travel at a constant velocity until a external forced is applied on it.")
st.write("This means if we are procrastinating we will continue to procrastinate until our deadline comes close or "
         "someone tells us to get back to work. This can also be used in the opposite way as well.")
st.write("## Two and Five Mintue Rules")
st.write("The two minute rule states that if a task can be completed in less than two minutes then it should be done "
         "immediately and if left undone this two minute tasks could pile up and become  2+ hours of work.")
st.write("The five minute rule states that if there is any task that needs to be completed but we aren't in a mood to"
         "complete it then just try working on it for five minutes as this tricks the brain into concentrating on the "
         "task and eventually completing it,")

# Making productivity fun
st.write("# Making Productivity Fun")
st.write("## Healthy Habits")
st.write("One of the best ways to be productive is to make a daily task such as handling emails into a habit."
         "Pick a time in your day and manage your emails daily at that time so that you don't have a huge inbox filled "
         "with thousands of emails that need to be responded to.")
st.write("> Building good habits is not a temporary goal but to build a better routine and overall self-image.")
st.write("## Productive Downtime")
st.write("You'll see that most people will have all the time in the world and will automatically be doing more than it "
         "looks like. This is because they make their down time into productive time as well.")
st.write("Down time is the break you take between tasks, if you have sent an email to someone and need their response "
         "before continuing your work read a book or article that interests you instead of scrolling social media or"
         " playing games on your phone while you wait.")
st.write("## Productive Procrastination")
st.write("If you have a deadline to meet at the end of the month then the best thing would be get started right now as"
         "you could complete your task before the deadline and create more useful output.")
st.write("But, like most people you'll probably procrastinate and while procrastinating isn't ideal it doesn't have to "
         "be bad. You can learn more about your task by watching videos on YouTube about it instead of cat videos.")
st.write("If you can make your procrastination period into productive time then you'll be more productive than ever.")
